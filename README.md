# Vermeer's Luminosity: A Study of Light in "The Milkmaid"

This repository hosts an educational module for art history students, focusing on Johannes Vermeer's masterful handling of light in his painting *The Milkmaid* (c. 1658–1660). The module provides an in‑depth analysis of Vermeer's techniques, the role of natural light, and the ways in which light defines form, texture, and mood.

## Structure

- `analysis.md` – the core analysis of the painting's light source and its effects.
- Future sections will cover Vermeer's broader approach to light, a bibliography, and interactive diagrams.

## Aim

To create a permanent, publicly accessible resource that combines scholarly research with clear, engaging exposition suitable for university‑level study.
